#Old Queen Cole#

Old Queen Cole
was a merry old soul
And a merry old soul
was she.

She called for her pipe,
and she called for her bowl
And she called for her fiddlers
three.

Every fiddler
she had a fiddle,
And a very fine fiddle
had she.

Oh there's none so rare,
as can compare
With Queen Cole
and her fiddlers three.

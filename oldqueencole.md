#Old Queen Cole#

Old Queen Cole<br />
was a merry old soul<br />
And a merry old soul<br />
was she.<br />

She called for her pipe,<br />
and she called for her bowl<br />
And she called for her fiddlers<br />
three.<br />

Every fiddler<br />
she had a fiddle,<br />
And a very fine fiddle<br />
had she.<br />

Oh there's none so rare,<br />
as can compare<br />
With Queen Cole<br />
and her fiddlers three.
